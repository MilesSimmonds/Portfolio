            <h2>The aim of this project is to develop a web-based data analysis tool that visualises key trends and disparities in maternal health outcomes
                 across the UK using a mySQL database with a publicly available maternity-based dataset.
                 This tool will focus on maternal mortality, prenatal and postnatal care access,
                 and demographic and regional variations within the maternity services.

                 <h2>     
                 By viewing the data in a visual format, users can gain insights into the trends and patterns of maternal health outcomes across different regions and demographic groups.
                 The tool will provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore the data through interactive charts and graphs, enabling them to identify disparities and areas for improvement in maternal health services.
