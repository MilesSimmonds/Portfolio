Tiki adventure is a classic platformer in which Tiki man (the player) needs to navigate the level, whilst collecting fruit in order to make it back to the village,
the more food he collects the more him and his fellow villagers get to eat! fruits are worth one point and superfruits are worth 5 points AND grant an extral life!

Controls :

Press the Space button to jump, you can only jump again when youve hit the ground.
hold the Shift button to sprint, this allows for larger jumps and a faster running speed - be careful not to run too fast and end up off the map!
